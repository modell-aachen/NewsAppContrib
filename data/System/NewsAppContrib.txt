---+++ Workflow
   1 *NEWSERSTELLUNG*
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">After creating a new news topic the author may check his news in the  *NEWSERSTELLUNG*  state.</p> <ol start="2"> <li> *PRUEFUNG* </li> </ol><p style="margin-left: 40px;">If the Author is satisfied with his news article, he may give it to the superior (department head for example) to confirm the news. When the superior is asked to confirm the news, its state is  *PRUEFUNG.* </p> <ol start="3"> <li> *FREIGEGEBEN* </li> </ol><p style="margin-left: 40px;">This state describe all confirmed news topics.</p> <ol start="4"> <li> *ABGELEHNT* </li> </ol><p style="margin-left: 40px;">In each previous workflow state, the current processor may discard the news, if the news may not be published</p>

---+++ Main sites
   1 *WebHome*
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">The landing page of the NewsApp display all confirmed News topics. The latest news will be displayed on top of the page. By the time, many news topics will be created and this page may become very slowly. Because of that, the WebHome page will only display 5 news topics and load the next 5 topics if the user scrolls down to the bottom of the page. If the user search for a specific news topic, he may use the wiki search.</p> <ol start="2"> <li> *Overview* </li> </ol><p style="margin-left: 40px;">After some time there may exist a lot of topics which are not approved but are in state <b>NEWSERSTELLUNG </b>or  *PRUEFUNG*  . The Overview page exists to display all news topics and their current state. Webhome and the RightBar display just news with the state  *FREIGEGEBEN*  (confirmed)</p> <ol start="3"> <li> *RightBar* </li> </ol><p style="margin-left: 40px;">On the top right Site of the page next to the  _My Site_  link. there is a new link named  *News*  . This link opens the RightBar, which slides in from right to the left. The RightBar display the last 5 news. Special is, that the RightBar can be opened from everywhere in the Wiki, even in another application. So each user has direct access to the latest news.</p>
